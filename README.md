# CSE203Project

## Setup

Using python3 (I have setup in a local virtualenv, but make sure to add to
  the .gitignore so it doesn't accidentally get checked in)
Need python3.7 or above for cvxpy 

Dependencies for cvxpylayers and torch on CPU / Cuda-10.2 can be installed via:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
